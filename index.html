			In most Traditional African religions and many other religions around the world, it seems correct 	to say that among the multitude of religions across the globe that there was/is one true creator of everything.
			In fact most religious hold many similarities, from deities that have similar roles to locations that are 
			considered sacred in this world. The great creator, dieties and locations are the focal point of the game.
			Therefore, that will be the focal point of the informational site about the game.
			The game starts with the main character, {players chosen name + The Great Creator} plunging down an abyss in
			his dream...or is it a nightmare. That will be his choice, you see in many religions in the deepest parts of Africa believe that there was one true creator of our whole dynamic universe. It is also said to believe that
			After the creation of the universe, he/she left us, to succeed or fail as a species on our own. In this universe this belief happens to be true, in fact. That's what the dream is about, the MC wakes up from his dream drenched in sweat with an appetite for adventure so big that even steve irwin's ghost would call him/her crazy. Something or someone draws the MC to a deep part of africa where the MC ends up finding out that he/she is the reincarnation of the great creator, and the job of the MC is to spread the word of the return of the true great creator. But, there is one small, minute, itsy-bitsy problem. The deities of the world have become to powerful in the absence of the great creator, the MC is tasked with finding allied deities and use them to battle the antagonist deities, when the MC defeats a deity, he/she gains them as an ally in the battle against the main evil deity, which is a recent deity whose true name is "human-shadow" in arabic, the human-shadow deity is derived from 3 main factors, money, technology and faith in false idols(such as celebrities or obviously made up deities).
